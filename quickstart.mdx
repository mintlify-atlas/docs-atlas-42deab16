# Quickstart Guide

This guide will get you up to speed with nvim-luffy's essential features and keybindings. Within minutes, you'll be navigating files, editing code, and managing your workflow like a pro.

<Note>
  nvim-luffy uses **Space** as the leader key. When you see `<leader>` in keybindings, that means press the spacebar first.
</Note>

## First Launch Experience

When you first open Neovim with nvim-luffy, you'll be greeted by the Alpha dashboard featuring ASCII art and the iconic quote:

> "Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."

The dashboard provides quick access to common actions:

- Press `f` to find files
- Press `r` to open recent files
- Press `q` to quit

Alternatively, just start typing `:e filename` to open a file directly.

## Essential Keybindings

### File Navigation

The core of nvim-luffy's productivity comes from its powerful file navigation tools.

#### Telescope Fuzzy Finding

Telescope is your command center for finding anything in your project.

| Keybinding | Action | Description |
|------------|--------|-------------|
| `<leader><leader>` | Find files | Fuzzy find files in current directory |
| `<leader>/` | Live grep | Search for text across all files |
| `<leader>fr` | Recent files | Browse recently opened files |
| `<leader>fc` | Find word under cursor | Search for the word under your cursor |
| `<leader>ft` | Find todos | Search for TODO comments |
| `<leader>fk` | Find keymaps | Search all available keybindings |

**Example workflow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find a file">
    Press `Space` then `Space` again to open the file finder.
    
    ```
    <leader><leader>
    ```
    
    Start typing the filename - Telescope will fuzzy match and show results instantly.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate results">
    Use `Ctrl+j` and `Ctrl+k` to move down and up through results.
    
    Press `Enter` to open the selected file.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Search in files">
    Press `Space` then `/` to search for text across your entire project.
    
    ```
    <leader>/
    ```
    
    Type your search term and see live results as you type.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Inside Telescope, press `Ctrl+q` to send selected items to the quickfix list for batch operations.
</Tip>

#### File Explorer

nvim-tree provides a visual file browser on the right side of your editor.

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|---------|
| `<leader>e` | Toggle file explorer |
| `l` (in tree) | Open file or expand directory |
| `h` (in tree) | Close directory or go to parent |

**File explorer workflow:**

```
<leader>e  → Opens nvim-tree on the right side
l          → Expand folders, open files
h          → Collapse folders, go up one level
<leader>e  → Toggle it closed when done
```

#### Harpoon - Quick File Marking

Harpoon is a game-changer for working with frequently accessed files. Instead of searching, mark your most important files and jump between them instantly.

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|---------|
| `<leader>H` | Mark current file with Harpoon |
| `<leader>h` | Open Harpoon quick menu |
| `<leader>1` to `<leader>9` | Jump to marked file 1-9 |

**Harpoon workflow:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark important files">
    Open a file you use frequently, then mark it:
    
    ```
    <leader>H
    ```
    
    Repeat for other important files (e.g., main.ts, config.lua, README.md).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Jump between files">
    Now you can instantly jump to any marked file:
    
    ```
    <leader>1  → Jump to first marked file
    <leader>2  → Jump to second marked file
    <leader>3  → Jump to third marked file
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manage marks">
    View and reorder your marks:
    
    ```
    <leader>h  → Opens Harpoon menu
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Window Management

Efficiently work with multiple files side by side.

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|---------|
| `<leader>\|` | Split window vertically |
| `<leader>sh` | Split window horizontally |
| `Ctrl+h/j/k/l` | Navigate between windows |

**Example:** Open two files side by side:

```
1. Open first file with <leader><leader>
2. Split vertically with <leader>|
3. Open second file with <leader><leader>
4. Navigate between them with Ctrl+h and Ctrl+l
```

### Buffer Management

Buffers are open files in memory. nvim-luffy provides quick buffer management.

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|---------|
| `<leader>bd` | Close current buffer |
| `<leader>ba` | Close all buffers |

### Code Editing

#### Insert Mode Basics

- Press `i` to enter insert mode at cursor
- Press `a` to enter insert mode after cursor
- Press `o` to open a new line below and enter insert mode
- Press `Esc` to return to normal mode

#### Code Completion

As you type in insert mode, nvim-cmp will automatically show completion suggestions:

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|---------|
| `Ctrl+Space` | Manually trigger completion |
| `Ctrl+j` | Next suggestion |
| `Ctrl+k` | Previous suggestion |
| `Tab` | Accept suggestion / jump to next snippet field |
| `Enter` | Confirm selection |
| `Ctrl+e` | Close completion menu |

<Tip>
  Completion suggestions come from multiple sources: LSP, snippets, buffer words, and file paths. LSP suggestions are the most intelligent, providing context-aware completions.
</Tip>

### Git Integration

#### Neogit - Git Interface

Neogit provides a Magit-like interface for git operations.

| Keybinding | Action |
|------------|---------|
| `<leader>gg` | Open Neogit in floating window |

**Using Neogit:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Neogit">
    Press `<leader>gg` to open the git status interface.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Stage changes">
    Navigate to changed files and press `s` to stage, `u` to unstage.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Commit">
    Press `c` to start a commit, type your message, then save and close to commit.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Searching and Replacing

<Steps>
  <Step title="Search for text">
    ```
    <leader>/
    ```
    Type your search term.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate results">
    Use `Ctrl+j` and `Ctrl+k` to browse matches.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Open in quickfix">
    Press `Ctrl+q` to send all results to quickfix list.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Replace">
    Use Neovim's native `:cdo` command:
    ```vim
    :cdo s/old/new/g | update
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Exploring the Codebase

<Steps>
  <Step title="Find the word under cursor">
    Place your cursor on a function or variable name, then:
    ```
    <leader>fc
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use LSP go-to-definition">
    Press `gd` to jump to the definition of the symbol under cursor (requires LSP).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Browse file structure">
    ```
    <leader>e
    ```
    Use the file tree to understand the project layout.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Pro Tips

<Tip>
  **Discover more keybindings**: Press `<leader>fk` to search all available keymaps. This is invaluable when you forget a shortcut!
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Telescope is everywhere**: Most of nvim-luffy's features integrate with Telescope. Look for telescope commands in plugin configurations.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Harpoon over tabs**: Instead of opening many tabs, use Harpoon to mark 3-5 key files and jump between them with `<leader>1-9`. It's much faster.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use the quickfix list**: When you send Telescope results to quickfix with `Ctrl+q`, you can perform batch operations on all matching files.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

Now that you know the basics, explore these topics:

- **LSP Features** - Learn about code navigation, diagnostics, and refactoring
- **Customization** - Adjust keybindings and plugins to match your workflow
- **Advanced Telescope** - Master advanced search patterns and filters
