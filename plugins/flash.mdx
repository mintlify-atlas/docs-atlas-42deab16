# Flash.nvim - Enhanced Motion

Flash is a powerful motion plugin that makes navigating code blazingly fast. It enhances Vim's built-in jump commands with visual labels, treesitter integration, and smart search capabilities.

## What is Flash?

Flash provides labeled jumps that let you move to any visible location with just a few keystrokes. Instead of counting or repeating motions, you type a trigger key and Flash shows labels at all possible jump locations.

## Configuration

Flash is configured in `lua/leyland/plugins/flash.lua:1`:

```lua
return {
  "folke/flash.nvim",
  event = "VeryLazy",
  vscode = true,
  opts = {
    modes = {
      char = {
        char_actions = function(motion)
          return {
            [";"] = "next",
            [","] = "prev",
          }
        end,
      },
    },
  },
  keys = {
    { "s", mode = { "n", "x", "o" }, function() require("flash").jump() end, desc = "Flash" },
    { "S", mode = { "n", "o", "x" }, function() require("flash").treesitter() end, desc = "Flash Treesitter" },
    { "r", mode = "o", function() require("flash").remote() end, desc = "Remote Flash" },
    { "R", mode = { "o", "x" }, function() require("flash").treesitter_search() end, desc = "Treesitter Search" },
    { "<c-s>", mode = { "c" }, function() require("flash").toggle() end, desc = "Toggle Flash Search" },
    { "<c-space>", mode = { "n", "o", "x" },
      function()
        require("flash").treesitter({
          actions = {
            ["<c-space>"] = "next",
            ["<BS>"] = "prev"
          }
        }) 
      end, desc = "Treesitter Incremental Selection" },
  },
}
```

## Keybindings

### Basic Flash Jump
| Key | Mode | Action | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| `s` | n, x, o | Flash jump | Jump to any location with labels |
| `S` | n, o, x | Flash Treesitter | Jump to syntax nodes |

### Remote Operations
| Key | Mode | Action | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| `r` | o | Remote Flash | Operate on remote location without moving |
| `R` | o, x | Treesitter Search | Search by treesitter nodes |

### Search Integration
| Key | Mode | Action | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| `<Ctrl-s>` | c | Toggle Flash | Enable/disable Flash in search |
| `<Ctrl-Space>` | n, o, x | Incremental Selection | Expand selection with treesitter |

### Character Actions
| Key | Mode | Action | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| `;` | n | Next match | Jump to next character match |
| `,` | n | Previous match | Jump to previous character match |

## Usage Examples

### Basic Flash Jump

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger Flash">
    Press `s` in normal mode to activate Flash jump mode
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Type target characters">
    Type the first 1-2 characters of where you want to go
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow the label">
    Flash shows labels at all matching locations. Type the label to jump instantly
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Treesitter Navigation

Press `S` to jump to semantic elements like functions, classes, or blocks. Flash uses treesitter to understand code structure and show you meaningful jump targets.

```lua
-- Example: Jump to a function definition
-- Press S, then select the label near "setup"
require("telescope").setup({
  defaults = {
    -- configuration
  }
})
```

### Remote Operations

Remote Flash lets you perform operations without moving your cursor:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Delete">
    `dr` - Delete remote: Press `dr`, type target, press label to delete
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Change">
    `cr` - Change remote: Press `cr`, type target, press label to change
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Yank">
    `yr` - Yank remote: Press `yr`, type target, press label to yank
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Incremental Selection

Press `<Ctrl-Space>` to start treesitter-based incremental selection:
- `<Ctrl-Space>` - Expand selection to next node
- `<Backspace>` - Shrink selection to previous node

## Tips

<Tip>
Flash works with all Vim operators. Try `ds` (delete with flash), `cs` (change with flash), or `ys` (surround with flash if vim-surround is installed).
</Tip>

<Note>
The `s` key is remapped from Vim's default substitute command. Use `cl` or `xi` for single-character substitution instead.
</Note>

<Info>
Flash is lazy-loaded on `VeryLazy` event, so it doesn't impact startup time.
</Info>

## Integration with Other Plugins

Flash works seamlessly with:
- **Treesitter** - Semantic navigation by syntax nodes
- **Search** - Enhanced search with labels (`<Ctrl-s>` in command mode)
- **VSCode** - Compatible with VSCode Neovim extension

## Troubleshooting

<Accordion title="Flash labels not showing">
  Make sure Treesitter is properly installed for your filetype. Run `:TSInstallInfo` to check parser status.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Conflicts with other s/S mappings">
  If you have plugins that use `s` or `S`, you can remap Flash in the keys configuration. Consider using `<leader>s` instead.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Slow on large files">
  Flash calculates jump positions in real-time. For very large files (10,000+ lines), there may be a slight delay. This is normal and Flash is still faster than alternative methods.
</Accordion>
