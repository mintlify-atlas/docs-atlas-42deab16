# Installation Guide

Get nvim-luffy up and running on your system with this comprehensive installation guide.

## Prerequisites

Before installing nvim-luffy, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

### Required

- **Neovim 0.9.0 or later** - nvim-luffy uses modern Neovim features and APIs
- **Git** - Required for cloning the repository and plugin management
- **A C compiler** - Needed for building some plugins (gcc, clang, or MSVC)
- **Make** - Required for building telescope-fzf-native

### Recommended

- **Node.js and npm** - Required for many LSP servers (TypeScript, ESLint, etc.)
- **Python 3** - For Python development features
- **ripgrep** - For faster text searching with Telescope
- **fd** - For faster file finding (optional but recommended)
- **A Nerd Font** - For proper icon display (FiraCode Nerd Font, JetBrains Mono Nerd Font, etc.)

<Tip>
  To check your Neovim version, run `nvim --version` in your terminal. If you need to upgrade, visit [neovim.io](https://neovim.io).
</Tip>

## Installation Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Backup existing Neovim configuration">
    If you have an existing Neovim configuration, back it up first:
    
    ```bash
    # Backup your current config
    mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.backup
    
    # Also backup your data directory (optional)
    mv ~/.local/share/nvim ~/.local/share/nvim.backup
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Clone the nvim-luffy repository">
    Clone nvim-luffy to your Neovim configuration directory:
    
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/nvim-luffy.git ~/.config/nvim
    ```
    
    <Note>
      On Windows, use `%LOCALAPPDATA%\nvim` instead of `~/.config/nvim`
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Launch Neovim">
    Start Neovim for the first time:
    
    ```bash
    nvim
    ```
    
    The first launch will automatically:
    - Bootstrap the lazy.nvim plugin manager
    - Install all configured plugins
    - Set up the plugin environment
    
    This process typically takes 1-2 minutes depending on your internet connection.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Wait for plugin installation">
    Lazy.nvim will automatically open and show the installation progress. You'll see plugins being downloaded and compiled in real-time.
    
    Once complete, you should see a dashboard with the message:
    
    > "Maybe the One Piece was the commits you made along the way."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install LSP servers and tools">
    nvim-luffy uses Mason to manage LSP servers and development tools. The configuration automatically installs:
    
    **LSP Servers:**
    - `ts_ls` - TypeScript/JavaScript
    - `html` - HTML
    - `cssls` - CSS
    - `tailwindcss` - Tailwind CSS
    - `svelte` - Svelte
    - `lua_ls` - Lua
    - `graphql` - GraphQL
    - `emmet_ls` - Emmet
    - `prismals` - Prisma
    - `pyright` - Python
    - `eslint` - ESLint
    
    **Formatters & Linters:**
    - Prettier
    - Stylua
    - Black & isort (Python)
    - ESLint_d
    
    These will install automatically in the background. You can check the installation status by running:
    
    ```vim
    :Mason
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Understanding the Bootstrap Process

The magic happens in `lua/leyland/lazy.lua`, where lazy.nvim is automatically installed if not present:

```lua
local lazypath = vim.fn.stdpath("data") .. "/lazy/lazy.nvim"
if not vim.loop.fs_stat(lazypath) then
	vim.fn.system({
		"git",
		"clone",
		"--filter=blob:none",
		"https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim.git",
		"--branch=stable",
		lazypath,
	})
end
vim.opt.rtp:prepend(lazypath)
```

This ensures that lazy.nvim is always available, even on a fresh installation.

## Post-Installation Steps

### 1. Verify Installation

Check that everything is working correctly:

```vim
:checkhealth
```

This will show you any potential issues with your setup.

### 2. Configure Your Terminal

For the best experience:

- Enable true color support in your terminal
- Install and configure a Nerd Font
- Set your terminal font size for comfortable reading

### 3. Customize Your Setup

While nvim-luffy works great out of the box, you may want to:

- Change the default colorscheme in `lua/leyland/plugins/colorscheme.lua` (currently set to "bamboo")
- Adjust keybindings in `lua/leyland/core/keymaps.lua`
- Modify LSP servers in `lua/leyland/plugins/lsp/mason.lua`

<Tip>
  The configuration is organized in a modular structure under `lua/leyland/`. Each plugin has its own file for easy customization.
</Tip>

## Directory Structure

After installation, your config will look like this:

```
~/.config/nvim/
├── init.lua                    # Entry point
├── lua/
│   └── leyland/
│       ├── core/              # Core configuration
│       │   ├── keymaps.lua    # Global keybindings
│       │   └── options.lua    # Neovim options
│       ├── lazy.lua           # Plugin manager setup
│       ├── lsp.lua            # LSP configuration
│       └── plugins/           # Plugin configurations
│           ├── telescope.lua
│           ├── harpoon.lua
│           ├── nvim-tree.lua
│           ├── nvim-cmp.lua
│           └── ...
```

## Troubleshooting

### Plugins Won't Install

- Check your internet connection
- Ensure git is installed and accessible from command line
- Try running `:Lazy sync` to force a plugin update

### LSP Servers Not Working

- Run `:Mason` to check installation status
- Ensure Node.js is installed for JavaScript-based LSP servers
- Check `:LspInfo` to see which servers are attached to the current buffer

### Icons Not Displaying

- Install a Nerd Font from [nerdfonts.com](https://www.nerdfonts.com)
- Configure your terminal to use the Nerd Font
- Restart your terminal after changing fonts
